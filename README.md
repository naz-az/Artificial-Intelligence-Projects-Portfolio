# Artificial Intelligence & Data Science Projects Portfolio


Welcome to my repository of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science projects, a rich compilation of my exploration, learning, and application of various AI techniques to solve complex problems. Here, you will find many interesting projects mostly shared as iPython notebooks. I use these projects to dive deep into the world of AI and data, discovering new techniques and finding exciting information hidden within the numbers and patterns.

In this collection, you will find projects across many areas such as:

- Making predictions with Regression
- Identifying and categorizing images with Image Classification
- Understanding and using human language with Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Understanding trends and patterns over time with Time Series analysis

For each project, I take an exciting journey through a maze of data. I use modern methods and clever ways to make the data tell its story. This is not just about playing with data; it's about finding real answers that can help solve real problems in our world today. Whether I am predicting trends, recognizing images, or finding meaning in language, each project is more than just an example of what AI can do. These projects show my dedication to using AI to find helpful solutions for today's challenges.

Sharing my work in this portfolio is more than just a demonstration of my skills and accomplishments in AI and Data Science. It is my way of educating and inspiring others to explore the endless possibilities in this ever-changing field. I believe that the greatest progress occurs when knowledge is shared and built upon. Thus, I invite you to dive into my projects, learn from them, and hopefully, find the inspiration to start your own AI journey.

Your questions or feedback are always welcome. Hearing from you helps me learn and improve, and it makes my work here even more worthwhile. Don't hesitate to get in touch if you have something to share. Contact me at: a.nasruddinazlan@gmail.com

Let's explore the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence together!
